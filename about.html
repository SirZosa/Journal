            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started in this year (2023), no later than february whatching the basics of html and CSS and then I got introduced to JavaScript. I didn't have a path to follow until I found Scrimba. <br> <br>
            Srimba is a platform that offers different courses, there was the full Frontend Developer path course that helped me a lot in my journey.</p>
